### Logistic Regression 
# Project Overview:
### Objective

Build a predictive model to determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. The output variable (y) is binary, indicating whether the client has subscribed ("yes") or not ("no"). This model leverages various input variables, including client demographics, contact history, and other attributes related to the marketing campaign.

# Dataset :

Input Variables:

Age (numeric)

Job (categorical)

Marital Status (categorical)

Default Status (binary)

Average Yearly Balance (numeric)

Housing Loan (binary)

Personal Loan (binary)

Contact Communication Type (categorical)

Last Contact Day of the Month (numeric)

Last Contact Month of the Year (categorical)

Last Contact Duration (numeric)

Number of Contacts during the Campaign (numeric)
